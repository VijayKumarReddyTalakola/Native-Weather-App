## Get Started

install dev dependencies

### `npm install`

### Note : install tailwindcss for 3.3.2 version

## Then

go to https://www.weatherapi.com . create an account and get the api key then paste that api key in your .env file and use it.

## Then

Run The app

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

### If you get an error as ViewPropTypes will be removed from React Native . Migrate to ViewPropTypes exported from 'deprecated-react-native-prop-types

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
